        Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for
        a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked
        and, when no one answered, she walked right in. At the table in the
        kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry.
